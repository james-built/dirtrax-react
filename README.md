# A trail mapping & sharing platform

## Introduction
This was my first idea for a personal project to work on during my EDA web dev bootcamp. The aim was to create a mapping app to guide you around the Woodhill MTB park & to have some additional features such as user reviews for trails & user updates on current trail conditions.

I experimented with the leaflet mapping library, and this repo is my second implementation of this when I went to shift the work I had done to React after we had learnt this. I found I was spending too much time reading the leaflet & leaflet-react docs and was not making as much progress with the app or learning other technologies I wanted to cover so put this project on pause.

As such this project is currently a WIP so check back in future when I will go back and implement all the features I hoped this app would have!
